# Senzor pentru calitatea aerului

-Calculeaza concentratia din gaz  
-<stroke>IMPORTANT</stroke>: Parts-per-million (abbreviated ppm) is the ratio of one gas to another. For example, 1,000ppm of CO2 means that if you could count a million gas molecules, 1,000 of them would be of carbon dioxide and 999,000 molecules would be some other gases.
