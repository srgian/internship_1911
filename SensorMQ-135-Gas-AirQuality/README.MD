# Senzor pentru calitatea aerului

-Calculeaza concentratia din gaz  
-**IMPORTANT**: Parts-per-million (abbreviated ppm) is the ratio of one gas to another. For example, 1,000ppm of CO2 means that if you could count a million gas molecules, 1,000 of them would be of carbon dioxide and 999,000 molecules would be some other gases.

* *When you start counting over 10,000ppm, most scientists and manufacturers change from ppm to percent concentration. So instead of describing a 10,000ppm CO2 sensor, we talk about a 1% CO2 sensor instead. (10,000/1,000,000 = 0.01) â€“ the terms are synonymous. In other words, 1ppm = 0.0001% gas.* *
